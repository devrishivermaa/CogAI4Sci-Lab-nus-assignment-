Overview: 
AD AUTO-GEMINI is an advanced reimplementation of AD AUTO-GPT, leveraging the AUTO-GPT framework to enhance its functionality. Developed as part of my internship assignment at the CogAI4Sci Lab, National University of Singapore, this project autonomously collects, processes, and analyzes intricate health narratives surrounding Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary goal of AD AUTO-GEMINI is to improve understanding and awareness of Alzheimer's Disease through automated data analysis, thereby supporting informed decision-making in public health.

Features:
1) Autonomous Data Collection: Automatically gathers relevant health narratives from BBC News and other sources.
2) Data Processing: Utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing techniques and the Gemini 1.5 Flash API for summarization.
3) Insight Generation: Produces valuable insights to inform public health strategies and enhance decision-making processes.
4) Visualizations: Creates impactful visualizations based on user queries, facilitating better analysis and understanding of the data.

Files: 
1) Reports : Contain all the main reports pdfs 
2) AD_Auto_Gemini.ipynb : Main code for reimplementaion 
3) text_outputs: Contain output of each step of the instruction library 
4) output_images: Contains visualizations
