Drug donanemab seen as turning point in dementia fightGetty ImagesA new drug, donanemab, is being hailed as a turning point in the fight against Alzheimers, after a global trial confirms it slows cognitive decline.The antibody medicine helps in the early stages of the disease by clearing a protein that builds up in the brains of people with this type of dementia.Although not a cure, charities say the results in the journal JAMA mark a new era where Alzheimers can be treated. The UKs drugs watchdog has started assessing it for possible NHS use.The drug works in Alzheimers disease, not in other types of dementia, such as vascular dementia.In the trials, it appears to have slowed the pace of the disease by about a third, allowing people to retain more of their daytoday lives and tasks, such as making meals and enjoying a hobby. Mike Colley, who is 80, is one of only a few dozen patients in the UK to take part in the global trial. He and his family spoke exclusively with the BBC. Mike gets an infusion each month at a clinic in London and says he is one of the luckiest people youll ever meet.Mike Colley L with his son MarkMike and his family noticed he was having problems with memory and decisionmaking, not long before he started on the trial. His son, Mark, said it was very hard to watch at the beginning Seeing him struggle with processing information and solving problems was very hard. But I think the decline is reaching a plateau now.Mike, who is from Kent, said I feel more confident every day.Donanemab, made by Eli Lilly, works in the same way as lecanemab  developed by companies Eisai and Biogen  which created headlines around the world when it was proven to slow the disease.Although extremely promising, these drugs are not riskfree treatments. Brain swelling was a common sideeffect in up to a third of patients in the donanemab trial. For most, this resolved without causing symptoms. However, two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain.Another antibody Alzheimers drug, called aducanumab, was recently rejected by European regulators over safety concerns and a lack of evidence that it was effective enough for patients. What is dementia and what can be done about it?How common is early dementia?Dementia Lifestyle changes that could lower your riskHelp and support for people with dementiaWhat those living with dementia want people to knowIn the donanemab trial, researchers examined 1,736 people aged 60 to 85 with earlystage Alzheimers.Half of them received a monthly infusion of the treatment and the other half were given a dummy drug, also known as a placebo, over 18 months.The findings showThe drug seems to have a meaningful benefit, at least for some patientsThose who had earlier disease and less brain amyloid at baseline derived greater benefit, in terms of clearance seen on brain scansThose given the drug also retained more of their daytoday lives such as being able to discuss current events, answer the phone or pursue hobbiesThe pace of the disease, judged by what people could still do daytoday, was slowed by about 2030 overall  and by 3040 in a set of patients who researchers thought more likely to respondThere were significant sideeffects and patients will need to be aware of risks of treatment Half of patients on donanemab were able to stop the treatment after a year, because it had cleared sufficient brain depositsAmyloid is just one part of the complex picture of Alzheimers, and it is unclear if the treatment will continue to make more difference over a longer period, experts caution. Before and after scans show how the drug cleared deposits seen in green, yellow and red from the brainThe drugs effects may be modest, but the results provide further confirmation that removing amyloid from the brain may change the course of Alzheimers, and help people affected by this devastating disease if theyre treated at the right time, they say. Prof Giles Hardingham from the UK Dementia Research Institute said It is terrific to see these results published in full today. We have waited a long time for Alzheimers treatments, so its really encouraging to see tangible progress continuing to gather pace in the field. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, from Alzheimers Research UK, said Todays announcement marks another milestone. Thanks to decades of research, the outlook for dementia and its impact on people and society is finally changing, and were entering a new era where Alzheimers disease could become treatable.Speaking to BBC Radio 4s PM programme, former Prime Minister David Cameron said resources should be put towards further research into what he called a statin for the brain. We want a pill that people who have the buildup of these proteins in the brain can take every day or every week in order to clear those proteins out of the brain and therefore reduce your chances of getting a disease that causes dementia, he said.Asked if the government were prepared to invest where needed to roll out new treatments, Mr Cameron said there was a real incentive to do so Were a country of sixty million people, with a million people with dementia, many of them in very expensive residential care settings and so there is a lot of savings to be had from effectively treating people.Im hopeful that our system can deliver.Lecanemab costs around 27,500 21,000 in the US, where it is licensed. It is not clear how much donanemab may cost and how long it might take to get approval in the UK, but Alzheimers experts said having two drugs would help promote competition on price. The UKs drugs watchdog NICE says it has already started work on its appraisal of donanemab for treating mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimers disease.Our aim is to produce recommendations on its use in the NHS as close as possible to it receiving its UK licence, said a spokesperson.Mike celebrating his 80th birthdayMike Colley turned 80 in April. At his birthday party, he surprised his family by singing My Way in front of 40 guests. He told BBC News Thats the confidence I have now. Id never have done that even 12 months ago. His son Mark added I never thought I would see my dad so full of life again. It was an incredible moment.Dr Emer MacSweeney, consultant neuroradiologist and medical director at ReCognition Health, led the trials of donanemab in the UK.She said This is really significant and one of the biggest breakthroughs.The Alzheimers Society said This is truly a turning point in the fight against Alzheimers and science is proving that it is possible to slow down the disease. Around 720,000 people in the UK might potentially benefit from these emerging new Alzheimers disease treatments if theyre approved for use, but the Alzheimers Society said the NHS is simply not ready to deliver them. Kate Lee, CEO for the charity, said Timely, accurate diagnosis is key, and currently only 2 of people in England and Wales receive their diagnosis through the specialist investigations needed to be eligible for these treatments.Alongside this, these emerging Alzheimers disease drugs require regular infusions and monitoring, and the NHS is not yet equipped to do this at scale.Ive got dementia  dementia hasnt got meWhat is Alzheimers and how common is it?DementiaAlzheimers

Scientists discover how brain cells die in AlzheimersGetty ImagesResearchers believe new findings about a form of cellular suicide gives new ideas for treating AlzheimersScientists in the UK and Belgium think they have figured out how brain cells die in Alzheimers disease.It has been a mystery and a source of scientific debate for decades.But the team, writing in the journal Science, connect the abnormal proteins that build up in the brain with necroptosis  a form of cellular suicide.The findings have been described as cool and exciting, as they give new ideas for treating the disease.Longawaited cluesIt is the loss of brain cells, called neurons, that lead to the symptoms of Alzheimers, including memory loss.And if you look inside the brains of people with the disease youd see the buildup of abnormal proteins called amyloid and tau.But scientists have not been able to join the dots between these key traits of the disease.This is what the researchers  at the UKs Dementia Research Institute at University College London and KU Leuven in Belgium  now think is happening.They say abnormal amyloid starts to build up in the spaces between neurons, leading to brain inflammation, which the neurons do not like. This starts to change their internal chemistry.Tangles of tau appear and the brain cells start producing a specific molecule its called MEG3 that triggers death by necroptosis. Necroptosis is one of the methods our bodies normally use to purge unwanted cells as fresh ones are made.The brain cells survived when the team were able to block MEG3.This is a very important and interesting finding, researcher Prof Bart De Strooper, from the UKs Dementia Research Institute, told the BBC.For the first time we get a clue to how and why neurons die in Alzheimers disease. Theres been a lot of speculation for 3040 years, but nobody has been able to pinpoint the mechanisms.It really provides strong evidence its this specific suicide pathway.The answers came from experiments where human brain cells were transplanted into the brains of genetically modified mice. The animals were programmed to produce large quantities of abnormal amyloid.There has been recent success in developing drugs that strip amyloid out of the brain and they mark the first treatments to slow the destruction of brain cells. New drugs for Alzheimers hailed as turning pointIve got dementia  dementia hasnt got meFiona Phillips How common is early Alzheimers?Prof De Strooper says the discovery that blocking the MEG3 molecule can hold off brain cell death could lead to a whole new line of drugs development.However, this will take years of research.Prof Tara SpiresJones, from the University of Edinburgh and the president of the British Neuroscience Association, told me that is a cool paper.She said it addresses one of the fundamental gaps in Alzheimers research these are fascinating results and will be important for the field moving forward.However, she stressed that many steps are needed before knowing whether it could be harnessed as an effective treatment for Alzheimers.Dr Susan Kohlhaas, from Alzheimers Research UK, said the findings were exciting but still at an early stage.This discovery is important because it points to new mechanisms of cell death in Alzheimers disease that we didnt previously understand and could pave the way for new treatments to slow, or even stop disease progression in the future.ONE OF THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC THEORIES OF ALL TIME Join Brian Cox and Robin Ince for a lesson on Einsteins theory of General Relativity DESERT ISLAND DISCS, RESPUN First broadcast in 1986, Elton John shares the soundtrack of his life in this classic edition Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.New drugs for Alzheimers hailed as turning pointIve got dementia  dementia hasnt got meWhat is Alzheimers and how common is it?DementiaAlzheimers

Alzheimers breakthrough Cure or hype?Published10 October 2013Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC NewsIf you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then Alzheimers cure or Major Alzheimers breakthrough headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimers within reach, external on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimers, external, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimers find is turning point.One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at Kings College London This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimers disease. So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?Significant momentThe prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease. This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word landmark repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study at the University of Leicester, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a druglike compound, they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused sideeffects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications. The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinsons the alphasynuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimers its amyloid and tau, in Huntingtons its the Huntingtin protein.The brains response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement. Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration.The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and thats whats so exciting.So wheres the cure?Its worth emphasising the precise findings of the study  a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with. Image caption, A section of brain with Alzheimers disease on the left shows the marked loss of brain cellsThat process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge. Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimers Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait.Im afraid its far longer than any of us would like, he said.I think there are many people whod be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today. I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before well know whether this will be effective.This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.More on this storyAlzheimers find is turning pointPublished10 October 2013

Alzheimers disease Experts hope for treatment by 2040Welsh governmentProf Julie Williams says research towards a treatment for Alzheimers is acceleratingOne of the UKs leading Alzheimers experts believes there will be a treatment for the most common forms of the disease within 20 years.Prof Julie Williams team at Cardiff University has identified 92 genes that significantly increase the risk of having the progressive condition.They knew of just three genes when their research began in 2009.Things are speeding up and improving all the time, said Prof Williams, who has studied Alzheimers for 30 years.Ive learnt more in the last seven years than I did in the previous 20, said the Merthyr Tydfilborn academic, who was appointed a CBE for her research.Wales rugby star links dementia to mental health issuesNeil Kinnock supporting wife who has AlzheimersAlzheimers disease affects the brain and is the most common cause of dementia  one of the UKs biggest killers of the over50s. Getty ImagesAlzheimers affects more than 850,000 people in the UK, but over65s are more susceptibleProf Williams, centre director at the UK Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University, said gene therapy, along with an improved understanding from international studies, was telling researchers more every day.Once you know where to start looking then you can study the effects which genes have on specific brain activity, she said. Tests which cost millions in the 90s can now be carried out for around 30.For example we now know that defective genes changing the way immune cells called microglia work. These are the bin lorries of the brain clearing away what they see as rubbish. They may be less efficient at clearing genuine rubbish and mistakenly kill off healthy brain cells, including synapses.Of course synapses are the connections between neurons, so if they get eliminated when they shouldnt then you lose connections, you lose thought, you lose memories.Getty ImagesProf Williams said if you have the right combination of genes theres nothing you can do to prevent AlzheimersShe said her study of thousands of cases made her realise there will never be one smoking gun, instead, the disease must been seen more like heart disease or stroke where many factors contribute and several therapies will help delay or prevent it. By 2040 I think well be in the position to offer a range of treatment and we might not know exactly why, but one of them will be able to act on the huge range of causes, she said.Some of the drugs have already been cleared for use in other conditions she added, and could be in clinical use inside five years.BBC presenter with Alzheimers thanks listenersAlzheimers research takes leap forwardIve got dementia  dementia hasnt got meWalesGeneticsMerthyr TydfilDementiaCardiffCardiff UniversityAlzheimers

Could cold water hold a clue to a dementia cure?BBCCold water swimming may protect the brain from degenerative diseases like dementia, researchers from Cambridge University have discovered.In a world first, a coldshock protein has been found in the blood of regular winter swimmers at Londons Parliament Hill Lido. The protein has been shown to slow the onset of dementia and even repair some of the damage it causes in mice.Prof Giovanna Mallucci, who runs the UK Dementia Research Institutes Centre at the University of Cambridge, says the discovery could point researchers towards new drug treatments which may help hold dementia at bay.The research  although promising  is at an early stage, but it centres on the hibernation ability that all mammals retain, which is prompted by exposure to cold.There are already more than a million people with dementia in the UK and the total is expected to double by 2050.Researchers are searching for new ways to treat the condition, as current options have only limited impact.Can cold water swimming treat depression?Cold open water plunge may provide instant pain reliefDementia Lifestyle changes that could lower your riskExperts excited by brain wonder drugBears and hedgehogsDoctors have known for decades that cooling people down can  in certain circumstances  protect their brains. People with head injuries and those who need cardiac operations are often cooled during surgery, as are babies.What has not been so well understood was why cold has this protective effect.The link with dementia lies in the destruction and creation of synapses  the connections between cells in the brain.In the early stages of Alzheimers and other neurodegenerative diseases, these brain connections are lost. This leads to the cascade of symptoms associated with dementia  including memory loss, confusion and mood swings  and, in time, the death of whole brain cells.What intrigued Prof Mallucci was the fact that brain connections are lost when hibernating animals like bears, hedgehogs and bats bed down for their winter sleep.About 2030 of their synapses are culled as their bodies preserve precious resources for winter.But when they awake in the spring, those connections are miraculously reformed.Why getting cold can be dangerousRuth CorneyCold has a powerful effect on the human body.The shock of entering cold water causes a dramatic rise in heart rate and blood pressure, which can cause heart attacks and strokes in those with underlying illnesses. It also prompts a gasp reflex and rapid breathing, which can lead to drowning if water is inhaled.The longer someone spends in the water, the slower their responses. People can become confused and clumsy, and find it hard to get out of the water.Dr Heather Massey of Portsmouth Universitys Extreme Environments Laboratory, says there are some key things to remember.Before taking a dip in cold water, make sure you are fit and healthy. If in any doubt, check with your GPSwim with others who are accustomed to cold water and know local hazardsGet out if you start to feel coldFind shelter, remove wet clothing and replace it with as many layers of warm, dry clothing as you can, including a woolly hat and gloves Keep moving around, do light exercise if you can, and dont worry about shivering  it will help get you warmBut Dr Massey says dont take a hot bath or shower. Changes in your blood pressure as you are rewarming, can cause you to faint and risk traumatic injury. Coldshock chemicals The Cambridge dementia team discovered the coldshock chemicals that trigger the process in 2015.They cooled ordinary mice, and mice with Alzheimers disease and prion neurodegenerative disease, to the point where they became hypothermic, which means their body temperature was below 35C.On rewarming, they found only the ordinary mice could regenerate their synapses the Alzheimers and prion mice could not.At the same time, they found levels of a coldshock protein called RBM3 soared in the ordinary mice, but not in the others.It suggested RBM3 could be the key to the formation of new connections.The BBCs Justin Rowlatt tries out cold water swimmingThey proved the link in a separate experiment which showed brain cell deaths in Alzheimers and prion disease could be prevented by artificially boosting RBM3 levels in mice. It was a major breakthrough in dementia research, and their findings were published in the scientific journal Nature.Winter swimmersProf Mallucci believed a drug which prompted the production of RBM3 might help slow  and possibly even partially reverse  the progress of some neurodegenerative diseases in people.RBM3 had not been detected in human blood, so the obvious next step was to find out whether the protein is present in the human population.In an interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme, Prof Mallucci explained that she would like to test the role of RBM3 in humans  but that ethical guidelines would make it very hard to get permission to make people hypothermic.Step forward Martin Pate, one of a small group who swim throughout the winter at the unheated openair lido on Hampstead Heath in London.He and the other swimmers voluntarily made themselves hypothermic on a regular basis he told her in an email, and would therefore be ideal subjects of a study.Prof Mallucci agreed, and during the winters of 2016, 2017 and 2018, her team tested for the protein in winter swimmers.The researchers used members of a Tai Chi club who practise beside the pool but never actually swim, as a control group. The Cambridge team found that a significant number of the swimmers had markedly elevated levels of RBM3.All of them become hypothermic, with core temperatures as low as 34C.None of the Tai Chi group showed an increase in RBM3 levels or experienced these very low body temperatures.Could cold slow dementia?The Cambridge work on winter swimmers has been shared in online lectures but has not yet been published in a scientific journal. A number of other researchers have found similarly higher levels of RBM3 in babies and heart and stroke patients who have been made hypothermic. What these findings show, says Prof Mallucci, is that  just like hibernating mammals  human beings produce the coldshock protein.But the risks associated with getting cold outweigh any potential benefits, so cold water immersion is certainly not a potential dementia treatment, she says.The challenge now, she says, is to find a drug that stimulates the production of the protein in humans and  more important still  to prove it really does help delay dementia. Dementia is predominantly a disease of the old, so even a relatively short delay in the onset of illness could have huge benefits for individuals, and the wider population.Prof Mallucci says If you slowed the progress of dementia by even a couple of years on a whole population, that would have an enormous impact economically and healthwise.Can cold water swimming treat depression?Blood test for early Alzheimers shows promiseAlmost 30,000 more care home deaths than last year

The Colombian Alzheimers family testing possible curesPublished19 May 2011Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage caption, Johnhaider, left, who has early onset Alzheimers, and familyBy Bill LawBBC Radio 4s Crossing ContinentsAn extended family in Colombia struck by hereditary and very early onset Alzheimers is taking part in a new drugs trial that doctors hope will lead to a cure for sufferers worldwide. Johnhaider sits in a wheelchair, rubbing one leg compulsively. His eyes are empty. He can no longer talk. He doesnt know where he is. He doesnt know his sister Patricia.Johnhaider is in the final stages of Alzheimers disease  the most common form of dementia. This is remarkable for two reasons. He is only 53, when most patients at the same stage of this terminal illness are in their mid60s at least. He is also a member of an extended Colombian family, half of whom will contract Alzheimers at an early age, according to medical researchers who have been monitoring the occurrence of the disease in the clan. There is now hope that research involving this family  who are described by one scientist as a natural laboratory  will help speed the discovery of a cure for this devastating condition. The clan is currently about 5,000strong and scattered across remote villages in the Andes mountains that surround the northerly city of Medellin  the second largest in Colombia. All are descendants of one couple of Basque origin, who settled here in the early 1700s. The man responsible for uncovering this familys cruel medical history is Dr Francisco Lopera, a behavioural neurologist at Medellins University of Antioquia. Dr Lopera first stumbled on the phenomenon in the early 1980s.I saw a man of 47 with dementia that was very similar to Alzheimers disease. That was curious because he was very young.Then Dr Lopera learned that the mans father, grandfather and several brothers had also suffered from dementia.Image caption, Scientists from around the world are working with the family to test theories about potential curesI saw we had three generations affected, and in each generation half of the children were affected. This was hereditary.Dr Lopera and a small team from his university scoured the region, despite the risks from drug traffickers and rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Farc.By the end of the 1980s, he had assembled a family tree stretching back nearly 300 years, big enough to cover the wall of an auditorium.It took another decade to isolate the cause  a gene thought to trigger early onset of the disease. If one parent has the gene, there is a 50 chance their child will have it too. Half the Colombian family members carry the gene, called the paisa mutation  paisa refers to the people of the region.This rare mutation in an isolated population has attracted scientists from the Banner Institute in Phoenix, Arizona  a world leader in dementia research.Dr Adam Fleisher, a geriatric neurologist at the institute, says Alzheimers is like an approaching pandemic. With life expectancy increasing, and the number of dementia suffers growing exponentially, the disease has the potential to devastate public healthcare systems in developed countries, he says. The truth is its going to affect you, and your ability to get healthcare, whether you get Alzheimers or not. We need to find a cure.The Banner Institute scientists will test drugs on the family which are designed to attack a neural plaque that builds up on the brains of all Alzheimers sufferers. The sticky, chewing gumlike plaque is caused by a malfunction which causes the misproduction of a starchlike protein called amyloid.The hope is that by using experimental drugs, growth of this amyloid plaque will be inhibited before the illness strikes. The Colombian family present researchers with the chance to work with healthy people before they develop dementia. Using lumbar punctures, brain scans and other techniques, they will monitor and measure those on the drugs and those receiving a placebo. The hope is that with funding in place, the trials can begin in late 2012.If in the extended family the onset of Alzheimers is delayed, or stopped, then the researchers will have hit the mother lode  a potential cure for sufferers worldwide. That remains a big if.Noone yet knows if amyloid plaque is the cause or an effect of Alzheimers. As Joseph Arboleda, a Harvardbased researcher working with Dr Lopera says, the trial puts this hypothesis to the test.It is possible that drugs will inhibit the brain plaque and yet the family will still get dementia. Such results would prove devastating for current research.Image caption, Doctors recruit members of the family for researchIt would be a huge setback for everybody, says Arboleda. The patients, the scientists  this is the best weve got. If it falls down everyone is in trouble.For the family, though, the burden of care, the terrible knowledge that for half of them the disease is inevitable, and that the paisa mutation will be passed on to half of their children far outweighs the risk of trialling unproven drugs.Johnhaider was in his mid40s when the symptoms first struck, and by that time his mother had already died from the disease. She too had begun to exhibit symptoms in her mid40s.Johnhaiders sister, Patricia, does not know if she carries the gene. At 49, and with no signs yet, she is hopeful but worried, and that is why she is prepared to take part in the trial.I have no options, she says, gently adjusting a worn blanket that covers her brothers thin legs.I am a little bit worried, says Patricia. But I want to participate its for me, its for my family, and its for the rest of the world.Crossing Continents is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 1100 BST on Thursday, 19 May and 2030 BST on Monday, 23 May.

New Alzheimers drug slows disease by a thirdGetty ImagesWe could be entering the era of Alzheimers treatments, after the second drug in under a year has been shown to slow the disease. Experts said we were now on the cusp of drugs being available, something that had recently seemed impossible. The company Eli Lilly has reported its drug  donanemab  slows the pace of Alzheimers by about a third. However two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain. Sticky gunkDonanemab works in the same way as lecanemab, which created headlines around the world when it was the proven to slow the disease. Both are antibodies like those the body makes to attack viruses. But these are engineered to clear a sticky gunk from the brain, called beta amyloid.Amyloid builds up in the spaces between brain cells, forming distinctive plaques that are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimers.The decadeslong battle to find treatments that change Alzheimers disease is changing, Dr Cath Mummery, the clinical lead for the cognitivedisorders clinic at the UKs National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, said.We are now entering the time of disease modification, where we might realistically hope to treat and maintain someone with Alzheimers disease, with longterm disease management rather than palliative and supportive care.The full details of Eli Lillys trial have yet to be published  but it has revealed the key findings1,734 people in the earliest stages of Alzheimers took partDonanemab was given as a monthly infusion until the distinctive plaques in the brain were goneThe pace of the disease was slowed by about 29 overall  and by 35 in a set of patients researchers thought more likely to respondThose given the drug also retained more of their daytoday lives such as being able to discuss current events, drive or pursue hobbies However, brain swelling was a common sideeffect in up to a third of patients. It was mostly mild or asymptomatic despite being detected on brain scans  but 1.6 developed dangerous brain swelling, with two deaths directly attributed to it and a third volunteer dying after such a case.We are encouraged by the potential clinical benefits that donanemab may provide, although like many effective treatments for debilitating and fatal diseases, there are associated risks that may be serious and lifethreatening, Eli Lilly group vicepresident of neuroscience research and development Dr Mark Mintun said.The company said it would begin the process of having its drug approved for use in hospitals in the next few months. Dr Liz Coulthard, from the University of Bristol, said there were significant sideeffects and a lack of longterm data but the drug could help people live well with Alzheimers for longer.Thought impossibleHaving two drugs slow the disease by targeting amyloid in the brain has also convinced scientists they are on the right track after decades of misery and failure. This should dispel any lingering doubts about this approach, Prof John Hardy, from the UK Dementia Research Institute, whose work led to the idea of targeting amyloid, 30 years ago, said. Having two drugs is great for competition.Dr Susan Kolhaas, from Alzheimers Research UK, said Were now on the cusp of a first generation of treatments for Alzheimers disease, something that many thought impossible only a decade ago.However, these drugs appear to work in only the earliest stages of the disease  before the brain is too damaged.And if they are approved in the UK, it would still take a revolution in how the disease is diagnosed to make a difference. Only 12 of people have either brain scans or a spinalfluid analysis to determine whether they actually have Alzheimers or another form of dementia against which the drugs would be useless.And the NHS would have to decide whether it could afford them. Lecanemab costs more than 21,000 per person per year. Follow James on Twitter.Alzheimers drug hailed as momentous breakthroughMedical researchDementiaAlzheimers

Daughter becomes scientist to find Alzheimers curePublished15 October 2010Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage caption, Dr Heledd Griffiths and her father, Gwilym, at a family wedding about a year before his deathA Wrexham scientist whose father had Alzheimers disease is taking part in a study into the way the condition develops.Dr Heledd Griffiths, 28, says she was led to research the disease after her father Gwilym was diagnosed in 1998. The once fit and active mans condition deteriorated until he was in a wheelchair and needed help with most tasks before he died four years ago. Dr Griffiths is joining a team which has received a 244,926 research grant.She said For my family as a whole, my fathers diagnosis was very difficult to come to terms with, especially knowing there was no cure and he was going to get progressively worse.Working in the field has allowed me to understand the processes involved in the development of the disease that burdened my father and continues to affect so many others.And it has also given me a unique opportunity to be part of a team of researchers working together to find a cure.She is joining scientists at the University of Leeds who have secured funding from the Alzheimers Research Trust to investigate the relationships between two proteins  amyloid, which is a hallmark of Alzheimers, and prion.Experts already know that in Alzheimers, amyloid builds up in the brain, causing brain cells to die. But recent research shows the protein attaches to prion before it inflicts its damage.Image caption, An early photo of a young Heledd with her father, Gwilym, when he was 72.The researchers will try to understand how this happens, and what role the prion protein plays in Alzheimers.One of the lead scientists, Prof Nigel Hooper, from Leeds faculty of biological sciences, said Our team has already been able to see an interaction between amyloid and prion, and we now want to monitor exactly what is happening and what the consequence of that interaction is.Ultimately, we hope this study will tell us more about possible drug targets, taking us a step closer to finding a way to stop the disease in its tracks. There are 820,000 people living with dementia in the UK, with 1,600 reported cases in Wrexham.Dr Griffiths father, Gwilym, who was diagnosed with multiinfarct dementia and Alzheimers disease, died when he was 85. Having such a close, young family helped us get through the difficult times, said Dr Griffiths, one of three sisters.I think the love that we showed him kept a little part of him alive. I know my dad still knew who we were, even if he couldnt remember our names. A squeeze of the hand or the occasional knowing look was enough to know he was still in there somewhere.The Alzheimers Research Trust is currently supporting 124 projects at UK universities. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at the Alzheimers Research Trust, said With dementia affecting more than 1,600 people in Wrexham alone, the need to act has never been more urgent, and investing in more research is the only way we will combat the condition.More on this storyAlzheimers risk seen in youngPublished23 September 2010Around the BBCBBC Health Alzheimers DiseaseRelated internet linksAlzheimers Research TrustAlzheimers SocietyLeeds biological sciences facultyThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Will I be diagnosed with Alzheimers like my mother?Sally Magnusson Sally Magnusson has already written a book about how her family coped with her mothers dementiaThere cant be many people who spend years raging and grieving over the decline of a parent from dementia without wondering if it awaits them too.Im one.My mother died of this vicious brain condition in 2012. And hardly a day has passed since when that question hasnt been darting around the edge of my mind, flaring ridiculously into view every time I misplace a word, a name or a pair of glasses.Actually its perfectly normal in a busy life to lose your specs or wonder what you went looking for in the cupboard.But tell that to those of us in the traumatised next generation, who have watched loved ones suffer in ways we can still hardly bear to think about. Is this, we ask ourselves, the start of the horror again?Curing Alzheimers is within our graspNow, for the first time, we can find out for sure. A simple blood test, taken as part of a research programme and backed up where necessary by a lumbar puncture and PET scan  which produce threedimensional images of the inside of the body  can tell us if amyloid, a brain protein implicated in Alzheimers disease, is already present.Ive made a film about what that means for individuals like me in their 50s and 60s with a family history of Alzheimers, the most common of the illnesses leading to dementia.And guess what? Deciding if you want to go through with it is not so simple.What is Alzheimers and how common is it?Trial of blood tests to spot Alzheimers soonerMy mother, Mamie Baird, was one of the pioneering female journalists of the 1950s. Bright, clever, quickwitted and funny, she was still writing and giving hilarious afterdinner speeches into her 60s.But like a million or so others in the UK, she succumbed to a disease that gnawed at her personality and cognition until it consumed her ability to function at all.Sally Magnusson Sallys mother Mamie centre was a pioneering journalist who was still writing and giving afterdinner speeches into her 60sThere was nothing to help her Little support, and no drug to mitigate the symptoms that over time made life an agony for her and for all of us who loved her.Dementia is not a natural part of ageing, although the risk increases with age. Its an illness caused by one, or a combination, of a number of brain conditions.My mother was diagnosed with both Alzheimers and vascular dementia, and although we had good times together in the years afterwards, many laughs and much joyfulness in the moment, the progressive incapacity and disconnection from herself were painful to her beyond words.Sally Magnusson Sallys daughter Anna Lisa is afraid of the implications of Sally finding out if she has the brain proteinFinestripeSally playing with her granddaughter RemyIn 2014, I published the book Where Memories Go, a mixture of memoir and journalism, to highlight what the experience is like for families who have to struggle on without hope of improvement  and I was stunned by the reaction.In the thousands of messages I got from across the country, it felt as if a great floodgate of pain and family loneliness was opening.Now 10 years on, there is hope.Testing, treatments and cureScientists have shown that the buildup of amyloid in the brains of people with Alzheimers can be successfully cleared.Theyre convinced that if drugs already in development and at least one, lecanemab, is now licensed for use in the UK, although not yet on the NHS are given to people before they develop symptoms, Alzheimers can be stopped in its tracks.Finestripe Prof Craig Ritchie says thousands of people need to come forward for testing before they are conscious of symptomsAs Prof Craig Ritchie, who runs the pioneering Scottish Brain Sciences SBS in Edinburgh, says We can cure Alzheimers before it becomes dementia  just as we learned to stop HIV before it became AIDS.But to do that, scientists like him need many thousands of people to come forward for testing before theyre conscious of symptoms.Which means that folk like me, still gaily going about normal lives and tackling demanding jobs, have to be prepared to find out that they already have the disease process of Alzheimers going on in their brains.Prof Ritchie, who I originally met through my work with the music and dementia charity Playlist for Life, suggested I join the enormous research cohort he is trying to gather at SBS.After all, Sally, he said, you might equally discover youre not amyloidpositive. Imagine the relief that would be.And if it turns out that I am? If I know what cannot be unknown, what then?Sally Magnusson Sally and husband Norman with their daughter Anna Lisa and sons Jamie, Rossie, Magnus and SiggyTreatments are coming, but theyre not here yet. The paradox is that only if people like me join research programmes like Craigs can they come in time to save those of us in our 60s now.I asked my own family about this.My four sons think I should go ahead and do it. Find out the truth, they say, and lets deal with it together.But my daughter, still traumatised by seeing what happened to her grandma, burst into tears.Shes afraid that if we do find out that amyloid is lurking in my brain, with no immediate means of removing it, the knowing will affect our present, not just our future.We are on the cusp of gamechanging developments today, which, if scientists are right, could cure Alzheimers soon.Biomarkers in the blood will allow people at risk to be identified and given the opportunity to participate in trials for new treatments.Thats good for them and its good for their children and grandchildren. But if these trials cant be run at scale with nonsymptomatic volunteers, scientists wont be able to develop this vital next stage of treatments.So they need people like me. What should I do? Thats what my film is about.Sally Magnusson Alzheimers, a Cure and Me will be broadcast on BBC Scotland at 2100 on Sunday 13 October. It will also be available on the iplayer.Sir Alex Ferguson Im 82, I worry about dementiaTwo new dementia risks identified by major reportWhat is Alzheimers and how common is it?Trial of blood tests to spot Alzheimers soonerScientists discover how brain cells die in AlzheimersDementiaGlasgowAlzheimers
